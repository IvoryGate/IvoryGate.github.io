## How to think in English

Hello everyone.

Today we are going to talk about how to think in English.

Learning to think in English is very important, because it helps you become more fluent.

When you stop tranlating words from your native language, you can speak faster and more naturally.

You will feel more confident when you don't have to stop and think of the right words.

This will also make coversations smoother becacuse you won't need to pause as much.

One of easist ways to start thinking in English is by using simple words in your daily life.

When you see something like a chair or a table, try to say the English words in your mind.

This a small but effective way to begin.
