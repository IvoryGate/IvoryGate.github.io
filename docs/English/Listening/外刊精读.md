## One Job is Enough - The rise of 'polyworking'

### TEXT

As workers face frozen salaries, `inflation`, and fear of `layoffs`. Some have decided to `branch out` from their traditional careers.

They are `taking on` second, third and sometimes fourth jobs to `bring in` additional income, and provide `a backup plan` should they find themselves out of work. This is something that's been called 'polyworking'.

Some are drawn to `side jobs` because of instability in their workplace, or worries that they may lose their income. Others `are reluctant to` trust one employer to provide steady job that `lasts` and are supplementing their main roles with `gig work` on food delivery or driving apps.

"We have seen `stagnant` saleries, we've seen inflation, we've seen cost of living overall increasing, even beyond our inflation meassures." said Alexandrea Ravenelle from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

"So people are looking for ways to supplement, and to build themselves a little bit of `a safety net`." Some are creating "portfolio careers" meaning they wrok for a variety jobs, each building different skills for their portfolios.

While there are advantages to `poly-working`, those who've done it warn that it probably won't help with your work-life balance.

"You have to love it", said Elaine Chen from Tufts University. "Usually it is something that person is really passionate about." But for others, it is not about passion at all, it's a financial necessity - one income is not enough to pay the bills, or repay loans.

And poly-working make other risks, when people are looking for side jobs, they should be cautious if an opportunity found online seems too good to be true.

Perhaps poly-working is to be admired - it's something that a lot of younger workers are doing to give themselves more options. But, Nadya Williams, who writes for the Institute for Family Studies, doesn't agree. In a blog post, she said:"Having to take on a second job - and working more than 40 hours a week just to pay the bills - is not a positive for our society".

## When Humanities Meet Python: China's Liberal Arts Go Digital

### TEXT

Face with a competitive job market and shrinking `humanities` programs, Chinese `liberal arts` graduates are increasingly learning coding and data skills to enhance `employability`.

A record 12.22 million students graduated in 2025, with liberal students `trailing` `STEM peers` in both `hiring rates` and salaries. Li Jialu, an advertising major, began teaching himself to code, discovering that programming skills improved his marketing performance and structured thinkings, `giving him a competitive edge` and `bridging the gap` between arts and technology.

Platforms like Xiaohongshu reflects this trend, with "swithing to coding" posts, generating millions of views and discussions. Online courses in coding, AI, and data analysis have searched allowing students to self-learn despite concerns about feedback and measurable progress. Some, like Chang he, persue second degree in data scicence to break into the tech industry, using AI tools to navigate unfamiliar coding challenges.
